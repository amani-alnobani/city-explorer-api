## Overview
1. Set up your server repository.
2.  As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.
3.  As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
